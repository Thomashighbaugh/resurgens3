# Resurgens III

## Introduction

This is the README file attached to Resurgens III, my portfolio website's third incarnation. This edition seeks to remedy some of the issues with the second Resurgens site (which is available [here](https://tlh-resurgens-v2.netlify.com/) for ease of comparison)

This is a temporary transition before I rebuild this site into a static React site (or semi-static depending on how I choose to go about it). Nonetheless this site addresses additional points of contention and desire to keep improving it, so I wrote this site as a means of addressing those points and demonstrate my comntinual work on web development (even if focusing on Bash scripts for now).

## Features

- Single Page Site - this site has no additional pages to navigate and employs tabs which help to organize and present the information. Easy Tabs provided by JQuery

- Modern - using the latest browser compatible standards with attention paid to the UX for compliance purposes.

- Responsive - designed to display in a comfortable way across devices and in a more complete way than was possible with Resurgens II's card system.


- Design Best Practices - Instead of using a dark background and brightly colored text (like my Desktop), this site conforms to design best practices while still having the flare of the Electric Tantra Design Paradigm that characterizes all of my work.

- Original Artwork - the profile picture and background are both original pieces by TLH. Any artwork that is not an icon is the product of TLH's artistic efforts.

- Project Tab - an answer to the awkward handling of this portion by the overwhelming majority of portfolio sites (or ideas for them). This tab lists the various projects that TLH has completed and is posted here as a means of demonstrating competence across multiple technology-related skill sets in a way that doesn't constrain such projects to specific categories nor is as jumbled as that which results from looking through directories on GitHub.

- Simplified Contact Access - From the first open tab, I have made it easy to quickly get contact information from the site, to simplify the hiring managers lives who may look at the site.

## Languages

### HTML5 // CSS3

The site is mostly HTML5/CSS3, which constitutes the structure and the appearance of the site as well as providing many of its functions if those were available within it before dependencies were brought in.

As with the second Resurgens site, this site did not employ them exclusively but was instead to demonstrate the means with which JS can be employed to enhance these languages.

### Javascript (ES6)

The Javascript provided with the site helps to create the effects and visual presentation of the site. As such it provides the "Easy Tabs" and navigation functionality to the site which enable the site to contain all necessary information.

Additionally, copies of the vendor JS files that were employed (or could have been) are included within the vendor subdirectory of the JS directory.

### Markdown

This file was written in Markdown notation, an easy way of quickly formatting a text file without the overhead of a word processor but all of the most useful features!

## Credits

- JQuery (easy tab, nav functionality)

- Normalize - standardizing DOMs across browsers

- The many designers and developers who I have borrowed design ideas and concepts from (too numerous to make individual)
